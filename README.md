## Installation

1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/Joey-Farah/Slippi-Ranked-Stats/releases/latest) page
2. Download `Slippi Ranked Stats_x.x.x_x64-setup.exe`
3. Run the installer

---

## Getting Started

1. Enter your **Connect Code** (e.g. `JOEY#870`)
2. Click **Browse…** and select your Slippi replay folder
   - Usually located at `C:\Users\<you>\Documents\Slippi`
3. Click **Scan Replays**
4. Click **Get Current Rating** to load your current Slippi rating

Your connect code and folder path are saved automatically — next time you open the app it will scan for new replays on its own.

---

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or later
- [Slippi](https://slippi.gg) with ranked replays saved locally

---

## Privacy

All data is stored **locally on your machine**. The app only makes two external requests:
- The Slippi GraphQL API (`internal.slippi.gg`) to fetch your current rating when you click "Get Current Rating"
- GitHub releases to check for app updates on launch

No data is ever uploaded or shared.

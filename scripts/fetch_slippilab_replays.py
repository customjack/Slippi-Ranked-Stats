fetch_slippilab_replays.py — Build grade baselines from SlippiLab community replays.

Downloads .slp files one at a time from the SlippiLab public API, computes
performance stats for both player ports immediately, then deletes the file.
Never stores more than one replay on disk at a time.

Outputs grade_baselines.json with two grouping dimensions:
  - by_player_char: benchmarks for each character the user might PLAY
  - by_opponent_char: benchmarks vs each character the user might FACE

Some stats are inherently character-specific (damage/opening, kill %) and
should be compared against by_player_char. Others are more universal
(neutral win ratio) and can fall back to _overall if no character data exists.

Usage:
    python scripts/fetch_slippilab_replays.py [--limit 1000] [--output scripts/grade_baselines.json]

Requirements: py-slippi, numpy  (pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt)

#     openings_per_kill   — Fox combos kill in 2 openings; Jiggs needs 5+
#     damage_per_opening  — Fox/Falco routinely deal 40+; Jiggs/Puff much less
#     avg_kill_percent    — Marth kills at 80–100%; Jiggs kills at 110–140%
#     avg_death_percent   — weight-dependent; heavier chars survive longer
#     l_cancel_ratio      — aerial-heavy chars (Fox, Falco, Marth) have more attempts
#     defensive_option_rate — roll/spotdodge rate; character-agnostic but style-dependent
#
#   CROSS-CHARACTER (fair to compare to all players):
#     neutral_win_ratio   — winning neutral is a universal skill; all chars aim for ~50%+
#     counter_hit_rate    — punishing opponent attacks; universal read quality signal

## What's New in v1.4.2

### Bug fixes

- **Scanner — linked codes now picked up on scan**: Previously, scanning a replay folder only ingested replays where your primary connect code was a participant. Replays played under a linked code were silently skipped and permanently marked as already-scanned, so they wouldn't appear even after adding the code. The scanner now processes all linked codes in a single pass and routes each replay to the correct code's database. If you had replays missing for a linked code, a **Force Rescan All** will pick them up.

## What's New in v1.4.1

### Bug fixes

- **Grading tab — set count corrected**: "X of Y sets graded" no longer reports an inflated count when you have linked codes. Previously, grades saved for sets from a linked code were counted in the numerator even after that code was removed. The count, grade distribution chart, and stale-grade detection now all scope correctly to your active code list.
- **Rating History — season-end marker**: The orange diamond marking the end of a past season now correctly appears on the chart. It was previously invisible because the marker's timestamp didn't align with any data point on the axis.
- **Rating History — multi-code note**: A note now appears when you have linked codes explaining that rating history tracks only the code at the top of your list.

## What's New in v1.4.0

### ⚡ Ranked Sessions tab (redesigned)
The old "Last Session" tab is now **Ranked Sessions** — a full session browser. All your sessions are listed on the left; click any one to see the complete breakdown on the right. The most recent session is selected by default.

Each session shows:
- Summary stats (duration, sets, games, set W/L, win %, game W/L, wins/hour)
- Sets played with opponent, score, characters, and stages
- Score distribution (2-0, 2-1, 1-2, 0-2), Game 1 win rate, deciding game win rate
- Stage win % chart and momentum chart

### 📝 Grading tab (new)
Every completed ranked set now gets a letter grade — **S through F** — based on how your stats compare to community baselines built from 177,000+ Slippi replays (345,000 samples across 26 characters, 183 matchup entries).

- **Three scored categories**: Neutral (40%), Punish (40%), Defense (20%)
- **18 individual stats** — 15 scored, 3 execution stats shown as info-only (L-cancel, IPM, wavedash miss rate)
- **Matchup-specific baselines** when enough data exists, falling back to character-wide or overall baselines
- **Win bonus**: +5 to your overall score for winning the set
- Grade history persists across sessions; stale grades are flagged with a one-click regrade button
- Filter by grade letter, W/L result, character matchup; sort by date or score
- **Grade distribution bar chart**: the summary card now shows a proportional bar chart for each letter grade
- After a set completes in a live watcher session, the grade appears inline in the Live Session tab

### 🔗 Multi-code support
Link multiple connect codes together in the sidebar — stats, sessions, matchups, and grade history all merge across every linked code. Useful if you have an alt, an old code, or changed codes mid-season. Add or remove codes at any time.

- All codes in the list are equal — no "primary" designation needed
- Grading works correctly for sets from any linked code
- Grades are kept in sync across all linked code databases, so adding or removing a code doesn't require regrading

### 🔓 Ko-fi support
Unlock premium access through Ko-fi in addition to Patreon. Discord role verification works for both.

### Other improvements
- **Sidebar toggle**: replaced with a clean hamburger button consistent in both expanded and collapsed states
- **Tab renamed and reordered**: Ranked Sessions at position 1, Grading at position 5, Live Session at the end
- **Connect code switching**: switching codes correctly reloads all data for the new code
- **Grading tab load fix**: no more blank flash when switching back to the Grading tab
